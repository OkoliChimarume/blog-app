# My Blog

A simple blog web app where users can create, view, and manage posts.

## Overview
This is a small personal project built with **React** for the frontend and **Strapi** as the backend CMS.

The app allows you to:
- Add new blog posts (with title, content, tags, author, and image)
- View all posts in a grid layout
- Delete posts
- Toggle the search field by clicking the **search icon** to filter posts easily

## Setup Instructions
Since the backend server isn’t deployed yet, you’ll need to **clone and run both projects locally** to experience the full functionality.

1. Clone the frontend:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OkoliChimarume/blog-app.git
   cd blog-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
2. Clone the frontend:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OkoliChimarume/blog-app-be.git
   cd blog-app-be
   npm install
   npm run dev
